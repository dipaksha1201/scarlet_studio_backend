## AI Scripts

Add standalone, executable Python scripts here. Use this directory for tooling
that supports data science or machine learning workflows rather than API code.

Suggested conventions:

- Make scripts runnable via `python ai_scripts/your_script.py`.
- Keep shared helpers in reusable modules under `ai_scripts/` if multiple scripts need them.
- Document required environment variables or CLI arguments within each script.
